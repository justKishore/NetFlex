Prior to coding, the most important step is to design.

If images below are not clear Use these 2 links: [Home page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1HzONglhHJoLIkjrhB0x3bWR7Sg5NjVkA/view?usp=sharing) and [Sign In page](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZIlXwTMbUpG8AedCiOc0J5Nt7M2jkiUB/view?usp=sharing).
